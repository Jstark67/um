Most time spent:
We spent most of our time debugging after we switched from a Hanson sequence
to a C array approach for our virtual memory system. 

Assembly code explanation:
We have already moved most of the functions into main, and looking at main
 (~99.x% of Ir at this point), we fouund that the most frequently called 
 instructions were mostly fetching the instruction, using inline bitpack/ 
 bitshift to get values from instruction, comparison (if and switch cases), or
  malloc/calloc. none of these can be optimized more as they are necessary 
  and/or have been reduces to the simpliest form we know.
